##**Introduction**
This repository, 52445_proj_19 , is my submission for Project 2019, module 52445 Programming and Scripting.  The project is an exploration of Fisher’s Iris data set [1] including research on the data set, documentation and code in the Python programming language [2] based on that research.  

The project begins with background information on Fisher and the Iris Data Set.  Next, the prerequisites to using the python code within this project will be outlined. A list of contents of the repository will be provided including each of the python programs created for this project coupled with a brief overview of each of the scripts listed.  Instructions on how to execute the python code will also be detailed.  A summary of the data set and a summary of the project will be set out.  Lastly, appropriate references used throughout will be documented.


##**Background**

###**Fisher**
[1]
###**The Iris Data Set Creation**
[2]

###**Fisher’s Analysis of the Iris Data Set**
The data set contains 3 classes with each class representing a type of Iris plant [3].  Within each class there are 50 instances [3].  Fisher found that one class is linearly separable from the other two classes[3]. While the other two classes are not linearly separable from each other [3].


‘One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other’ [3] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).  Define ‘Linear Separability’[4]
‘Linear separability refers to the fact that classes of patterns with -dimensional vector  can be separated with a single decision surface. In the case above, the line  represents the decision surface.
’
