## **Introduction**
This repository, 52445_proj_19 , is my submission for Project 2019, module 52445 Programming and Scripting.  The project is an exploration of Fisher’s Iris data set [1] including research on the data set, documentation and code in the Python programming language [2] based on that research.  

The project begins with background information on Fisher and the Iris Data Set.  Next, the prerequisites to using the python code within this project will be outlined. A list of contents of the repository will be provided including each of the python programs created for this project coupled with a brief overview of each of the scripts listed.  Instructions on how to execute the python code will also be detailed.  An exploratory data analysis summarizing the dataset will be included.  Lastly, appropriate references used throughout will be documented.


## **Background**

### **Fisher**
[1]
### **The Iris Data Set Creation**
 Dr. E. Anderson collected the Iris data which Fisher then used in his 1936 Analysis [2].  The data set contains 3 classes with each class representing a type of Iris flower specie [2]. The first two species Iris setosa and Iris versicolor were found growing together [2], while the third species, Iris Virginica separately was found separately [2]. For each class, 50 samples were collected.

 The data set is a multivariate data set and has four variables/features/attributes for each sample/observation. The four variables measured for each sample collected were:
   1. sepal length in cm
   1. sepal width in cm
   1. petal length in cm
   1. petal width in cm
  This iris image shows the petal and sepal components of an Iris flower[5]![Iris image](https://github.com/fionaoriordan/52445_19_iris/blob/master/iris_with_labels.jpg) 
 
 

### **Fisher’s Analysis of the Iris Data Set**
 Fisher's analysis was published in The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, 1936 [2].  Fisher found that one class is linearly separable from the other two classes[3]. While the other two classes are not linearly separable from each other [3]. The dataset is infamous in the computer science field of pattern recognition [3]. 'Pattern recognition is one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. It involves finding the similarities or patterns among small, decomposed problems that can help us solve more complex problems more efficiently' Verbatim(https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/zxxbgk7/revision/1).


‘One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other’ [3] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).  Define ‘Linear Separability’[4]
‘Linear separability refers to the fact that classes of patterns with -dimensional vector  can b e separated with a single decision surface. In the case above, the line  represents the decision surface.


## **To Download the Iris Data Set**
1. In your internet browser open [Kaggle.com Iris Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris). 
1. Click on the link ![Download4KB](https://github.com/fionaoriordan/52445_19_iris/blob/master/kaggleirisdownload.png).
1. Register with site.
1. Open the now downloaded folder 'iris-species' in your Downloads folder on your computer.
1. You can now view the Iris Data set by clicking on the Iris.csv file.

## **Executing the python programs

1. In the [repository page 52445_19_iris](https://github.com/fionaoriordan/52445_19_iris/blob/master/iris_with_labels.jpg) click on Download Zip ![download Zip](image file required).
1. Once the repository has been saved to your downloads folder locally, then move to your desktop.
1. Launch your Command Line Interface (see above).
1. Open the Desktop directory with command: cd Desktop
1. Open the folder 52445_19_iris with command: cd 52445_19_iris
1. To run a script type python followed by the script name at the command line prompt e.g. python .py
1  script specific instructions…

## **Exploratory Data Analysis

This sections seeks to analyse the iris data set using python and produce a clear understanding of the dataset.

4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
5. Write a summary of your investigations.
6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.

1. A statiscal summary of the dataset is generated by desciris.py with output:
